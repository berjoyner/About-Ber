			Hello fellow Iron Yard Front End Classmates! My name is Amber Joyner. Prior to making the life change to become an engineer, I was an Elementary school teacher who taught 6th grade ELA & Social Studies in Myrtle Beach, SC. Shortly after moving to Charleston I became a middle school lab instructor where I worked with small groups of students in an academic recovery program. Although I enjoyed teaching, it always left me wanting something more outside of the classroom walls.

			I have always had a passion for technology and coding but honestly was never truly sure of myself or my skills to pursue it as a career. I was involved with technology earlier on in life with video games and computer software (ah the days of AOL Instant Messenger, Dial-up, mIRC, and Geocities/Angelfire)
			I was the tech guru on my school hallways and always enjoyed helping other people use technology and the fufilling sense of accomplishment. I would love to create new ideas and technology to better the user experience.
